The .mat data file has been put in the folder for convenient loading.
Order of code execution:
1)Data Process:For preprocessing of data,converts 3D data to 2D data,removes points with zero labels,normalisation,etc.
2)One-hot:For one hot encoding.
3)SoftmaxImplementation:For learning the the hypothesis.
4)Testing:for checking the accuracy for training and test data both.


Increasing number of iterations will increase the accuracy of code.But it becomes super slow.
